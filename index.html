Background 
Medical image analysis is a field of study that involves the processing, interpretation, and analysis of medical images. (Mengfang Li,  Yuanyuan Jiang, Yanzhou Zhang and Haisheng Zhu, 2023)
In South Sudan, there’s poor diagnostic procedures; delayed time for lab results, CT Scanned Image Interpretation, MRI image interpretation, Cancer Cells tumor interpretation. Lung Cancer Detection using deep learning involves utilizing advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze medical images like X-rays, CT Scans, or MRIs, automatically detecting abnormalities and assisting health care professionals in diagnosing diseases with high accuracy, often by identifying patterns and features that might be difficult for humans to perceive manually; this can lead to earlier detection, improved treatment planning, and better patient outcomes. The emergence of deep learning algorithms has prompted a notable transformation in the field of medical image analysis, as they have increasingly been employed to enhance the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of diverse medical conditions in recent years.
